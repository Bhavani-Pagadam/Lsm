# Problem Statement / Use Case:
Students currently rely on multiple platforms for academic management, learning resources, and coding practice, causing fragmentation and inefficiencies. There is a need for a unified platform that integrates academic LMS functionalities with coding skill development tools.

# Abstract / Problem Description:
Campus Bridge is a full-stack web application designed to integrate essential features of a Learning Management System (LMS) with a coding skill development environment. It aims to provide a seamless experience for students and faculty by combining course content, assignments, attendance tracking, and AI-powered learning assistance with tools like collaborative coding, coding challenges, and real-time feedback. The platform serves as a one-stop solution for students' academic and technical growth, eliminating the need to juggle multiple systems and improving learning outcomes. The system includes features like student-faculty dashboards, automated grading, AI assistants for doubts, and peer collaboration toolsâ€”all aimed at building a smart and connected academic ecosystem.
